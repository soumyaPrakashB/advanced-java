-> JSP pages must have .jsp extensions.
-> JSP pages get processed in the server(tomcat/JBoss/WebSphere...).
-> JSP pages are just HTMLs with Java code sprinkled in. When server receives a request it processes the request,
   and send the rendered HTML page to the browser. Browser doesn't know about the Java code.
-> We can put JSP scripting elements in the JSP file in the below 3 ways:

		1. JSP Expression: <%= Java expression %>
			eg. <%= new java.util.Date() %> // The expression is evaluated and the result is included in the final HTML
		
		2. JSP Scriptlet: <% Java code, 1 to many lines %>
			eg. <% 
					for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
						out.println(i);
					}
				%>
		
		3. JSP Declarations: <%! variable or method declarations %>
			eg. <%!
					int addOne(int input) {
						return input + 1;
					}
				%>
   
-> Call Java class from JSP
===========================

Use fully qualified package name to call methods of a class.

Alternatively, import statements could be used.

	<%@ page import="com.example.jsp.*" %>


-> Built-In Server Objects
==========================

These objects can be used directly in JSP pages.

Commonly used JSP objects:
	
	Object					Description
	===========================================================================
	request					Contains HTTP request headers and form data
	response				Provides HTTP support for sending response
	out						JspWriter for including content in HTML page
	session 				Unique session for each user of the web application
	application				Shared data for all users of the web application
	
	
-> Including Files in JSP
=========================
You can include JSP or HTML files to another JSP file.

The syntax is as below:
		<jsp:include page="file-name.extension" />
